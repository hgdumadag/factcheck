# 
# For local development:
# 1. Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml
# 2. Add your actual API keys
# 3. Never commit secrets.toml to git (it's in .gitignore)
#
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
# 1. Go to your app settings on streamlit.io
# 2. Navigate to "Secrets" section
# 3. Add these keys there (without the quotes around the section names)

DASHSCOPE_API_KEY = "sk-your-dashscope-api-key-here"

# Optional: Google Custom Search (for enhanced search results)
